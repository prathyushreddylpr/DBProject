## Project Summary

Investing is an effective way to put your money to work and potentially build wealth. There are no real applications that maintain people's investment portfolios with different kinds of investments up to date.Hence we propose a comprehensive application where we maintain users investments, suggest the investments that suit their budget, and the risk they are willing to take.

Users can look at their existing investments, make new investments, or withdraw investments based on the suggestions. We suggest different types of investments to the users based on the risk that they want to take and their budget. The users are given with multiple options and the choice on what to invest in.
